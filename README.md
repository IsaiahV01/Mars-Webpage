This is a zipfile with all the contents from my project. Inside the zip there is all the html,css,php,and mysql database files you should need to recreate what I created. 
From personal tests, this ran on AMPPS localhost servers and they did not work on a regular browser because it utilized PHP.

Here's a link to download AMPPS if you do not have it already, it is free:

https://ampps.com/


After downloading and running the app, extract the zipfile into the "www" folder in Ampps, then on the Ampps popup window, press the globe image.
